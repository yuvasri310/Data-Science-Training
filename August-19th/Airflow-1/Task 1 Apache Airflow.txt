1. What is Apache Airflow, and how does it work?
Apache Airflow is an open-source workflow orchestration tool that helps schedule, monitor, and manage complex data pipelines. It works by defining workflows as DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs), where each task represents a step in the pipeline. Airflow uses a scheduler to determine when tasks should run, an executor to distribute work, and a metadata database to track progress. Tasks can be run using Python, Bash, or integrations with external systems.

2. Where does Airflow fit in modern data engineering workflows?
ETL/ELT pipelines (extracting data from sources, transforming it, and loading into warehouses).
Batch data processing (running jobs hourly/daily on large datasets).
Machine learning pipelines (model training, evaluation, deployment).
Data quality and auditing workflows (ensuring rule compliance before data consumption).

3. How is Airflow different from traditional schedulers or other tools like Prefect or Luigi?
Compared to cron/traditional schedulers:
Cron only triggers jobs at fixed times; Airflow manages dependencies, retries, and failure recovery.
Airflow provides a web UI and monitoring tools, unlike basic cron logs.
Compared to Luigi:
Luigi focuses on task dependencies but has limited scheduling and monitoring features.
Airflow is more extensible with plugins and a larger ecosystem.
Compared to Prefect:
Prefect is newer and emphasizes cloud-native execution and simplicity.
Airflow is more mature, enterprise-ready, and widely adopted in production environments.

4. What are the key components, and how do they interact?

DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs): Define the workflow structure (tasks + dependencies).
Operators: The building blocks of tasks (e.g., PythonOperator, BashOperator, SQL operators).
Scheduler: Decides when tasks should run based on schedule/conditions.
Executor: Runs the tasks, either locally or on distributed clusters.
Metadata Database: Stores states, logs, and history of all DAG runs.
Web UI: Provides a visual interface for monitoring, debugging, and managing workflows.

Interaction: The DAG defines tasks → Scheduler checks schedule → Executor runs tasks → Database tracks states → Web UI shows results.

5. Based on your learning, where do you see Airflow being useful in real-time enterprise or product scenarios?
Finance: Automating daily transaction audits and fraud detection pipelines.
E-commerce: Running hourly data pipelines to update product catalogs, prices, and recommendations.
Healthcare: Managing sensitive patient data pipelines and compliance checks.
Telecom & IoT: Orchestrating large-scale log processing and event-driven alerts.
Machine Learning: Automating retraining and deployment of ML models based on new data.
